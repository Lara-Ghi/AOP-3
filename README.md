## ðŸ“Œ The Third Exercise  
The third exercise consists of an application that helps visualize data for better analysis.

After running the command "dotnet run" in the terminal, a window will open displaying the dashboard. To view the graphs, simply click the buttons located on the left-hand side. Clicking the buttons again will hide the respective graphs.

You can resize the graphs by dragging their corners. Additionally, some charts â€” such as the Listening Time Chart â€” support zooming (by scrolling the mouse wheel) for enhanced viewing.

## Flaws
Unfortunately, the dynamic resizing of the graphs does not work as intended, since the graphs tend to overlap and not adjust to the size of the main window.
